      works
      have nothing in common, I spent countless hours on each of them to make sure to bring out products that people can
      enjoy and for me to gain experience in trying something new. These are definitely not the best ones out in the

              The game, <i>Genshin Impact</i>, is always releasing new characters with unique combat abilities and
              stories, yet which characters are most popular with
              the players? The website seeks to answer the question by pulling data from both Reddit and Google Trends.
              The data can be visualized from a spreadsheets,
              graphs, and various other means to compare popularity. It's important to note that this data is from
              September 2022, thus it will not be an accurate
              representation of what the players think about newer regions like Sumeru, who barely have time to
              develop.

              When it comes to 3D modeling, I am definitely a novice. I would say that my speciality is low poly and
              flat colors due
              to the fact it is the easiest to make. While I'm mainly working with buildings, I'd like to start working
              on making
              characters so I can start making 3D Elysium games (or 2.5D games). <br /><br /> I would say the hardest
              thing
              about modeling is getting the shape right for an object, or at least best representing it. I found this
              idea
              challenging me whenever I make items like dressers and drawers. The second hardest thing is probably poly
              count.
              While I do my best to reduce the polys, it always end up being a lot.

      <h3>The Code</h3>
      <p>
        I have a strong track record when it comes to 2D games, so doing 3D, no less virtual reality (VR) was a big jump. 
        As this was my first time working with 360, there was a lot of things that I had to figure out. 
        For example, moving between scenes is not as simple as making a timer in the UI run out, and figuring out how the 
        player will chose how to move to different scenes was also a big step. This took three whole days of trial, testing, and errors to
        successfully deliever this product.

              The controller script so that the player may use their hands in the experience to pick up objects. I wanted the player to be immersed
              in the story rather than just needing to be physically there. In order to do that, I wanted to use both their sight and virtual touch
              so that they may interact with their world and make sitting through the long dialogs a little bit more fun.

              Changing the button color to allow players to know which scene they already visited. It can cause some confusion on what scenes a 
              player already visited, and in order to make the playing expierence easier, I made it so that colored in buttons were places they
              already visited. <br/><br/>I don't work that much with UI other than the extreme basics that are needed for making visual novels,
              so making these buttons to work as they did required a lot of research and then testing on my part.

              With the hand functionality, I added a little item that players to interact with that contains both the UI to go to other
              scenes as well as something fun to toss around with zero gravity. This script works by seeing when the video ends, checks the scene,
              and adds to a counter that tells the system the player have finished visiting this site. This part later helps when deciding if 
              the player gets the good end or the bad end.
